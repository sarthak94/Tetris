When the game is initially started , a window explaining the controls pops up. Once the game starts, the pieces start falling down. The speed of the movement increases as the game progresses. The user can save one piece at a time by hitting ‘Z’ and then can save another one only after releasing the saved piece by pressing the ‘X’ key. The upper piece displayed on the right panel of the frame is the next piece. The lower piece on that panel is the one saved by the user. The score increases by ten points every time one row gets deleted.The maximum score in the game is 200. Please keep the volume up for the game music.
